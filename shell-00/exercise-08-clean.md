# Exercise 08 : clean

• In a file called clean place the command line that will search for all files - in the current directory as well as in its sub-directories - with a name ending by \~, or a name that start and end by #&#x20;

• The command line will show and erase all files found.&#x20;

• Only one command is allowed: no ’;’ or ’&&’ or other shenanigans.
