# Exercise 04 : midLS

* In a midLS file, place the command line that will list all files and directories in your current directory (except for hidden files or any file that starts by a dot - yes, that includes double-dots), separated by a comma and a space, by order of modification date. Make sure the directoryâ€™s names are followed by a slash character.
